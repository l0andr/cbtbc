# CBTBC
## Condition-based text binary classification 
is a framework for NLP (Natural Language Processing) and text classification.

### Key Benefits
* Requires a low amount of pre-labeled data (Ground Truth) for training productive and robust models.
* Utilizes self-explainable models that can be used in critical areas where black-box solutions are unwelcome.
* Features AutoML algorithms - simply provide a set of texts and the condition-based model will be generated automatically.
